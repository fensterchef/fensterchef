# Fensterchef â€“ The X11 Tiling Window Manager

Fensterchef is a keyboard-centric tiling window manager for X11.

### Fensterchef includes

- Manual tiling
- Dynamic tiling
- Floating windows
- Dock windows of any kind
- Desktop windows
- Fullscreen windows
- Minimizing windows
- A simple configuration
- Sending of external commands

### Fensterchef does not include

- A builtin bar
- Window frames (only simple borders)
- Desktops or workspaces in i3 terms

### Why no workspaces?

Workspaces are a good way to group windows together but since windows can be
minimized and re-opened at any time through the window list or special hotkeys,
there is no need for that.

## Gallery

I am a boring person when it comes to customizing but this is how it might look:

## Installation

Get started immediately! Open a terminal and clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/thepsauce/fensterchef.git
```
(Optional) If you want to check out the currently developing features:
```sh
git checkout developing
```
Then simply type the following and enter your password.
```sh
sudo make install
```

Now you have the **fensterchef** executable (`/usr/bin/fensterchef`) and the two
manual pages (`/usr/share/man/man1/fensterchef.1.gz` and
`/usr/share/man/man5/fensterchef.5.gz`).

If you are using a login manager, you can simply put this at the end of your
`~/.xsession`:
```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fensterchef
exec /usr/bin/fensterchef -dinfo 2>~/.local/share/fensterchef
```
Alternatively put it into the `~/.xinitrc`.

*How to get fensterchef to run exactly varies on your environment.*

### Try it out in the sandbox

If you have Xephyr installed you can (after cloning the repository) do:
```sh
make sandbox
```
This will open a 800x600 window in your current desktop environment in which you
can try out **fensterchef**.
